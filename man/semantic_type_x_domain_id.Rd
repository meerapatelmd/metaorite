semantic_type_x_domain_id()
}
\description{
Crosswalk Between UTS Semantic Type and OMOP Domain Id
}
\details{
Note that this crosswalk is subjective and is constrained to the Observation, Device, Drug, Procedure, and Measurement domains only. If a Semantic Type is not applicable to OMOP, such as Fish and Reptile Semantic Types, they are given a Domain Id of NA. It is also important to note that the mappings between Semantic Type and OMOP Domain Id can be 1 to many.
