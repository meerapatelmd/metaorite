\usage{
search_string(
  conn,
  concept,
  split = " ",
  schema = "mth",
  match_case = TRUE,
  cache_only = FALSE,
  skip_cache = FALSE,
  override_cache = FALSE

\arguments{
\item{conn}{Postgres connection}

\item{concept}{Concept to be searched}

\item{split}{Regular expression to split the concept on to generate words for this style of search. Defaults to a space.}

\item{schema}{Metathesaurus schema}

\item{match_case}{If TRUE, both the MRCONSO STR column and the `concept` argument are converted to lowercase.}

\item{cache_only}{If TRUE, only the cache is loaded and database querying is skipped. If a cache did not exist for the query, a NULL will be returned.}

\item{skip_cache}{If TRUE, the cache is skipped altogether. The database is directly queried and the resultset is not cached.}

\item{override_cache}{If TRUE, the cache is not loaded, the database is directly queried and the resultset is cached, overwriting any existing cache that may have been present.}
}
\value{
Dataframe of 0 or more rows of all the fields in the MRCONSO Table.
}
\description{
These functions help search for mappings between an a concept and a Metathesaurus identifier in the MRCONSO Table. All queries are cached using the R.cache package for quicker retrieval of the more computationally expensive searches.
}
\details{
A 'String' style of search splits the concept into a vector of length 1 or greater based on the `split` argument. Seaches of this style will return all matches where all the results of the split were present.
